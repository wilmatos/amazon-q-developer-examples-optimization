# Image Processor Optimization Task

I need your help optimizing an image processing application that has several intentional inefficiencies. The application processes images with various transformations like resize, blur, sharpen, contrast, and brightness adjustments.

## Tasks:

1. **Run tests and analyze performance bottlenecks**:
   - Run the tests using the devfile.yaml commands
   - Analyze the profiling results to identify the main performance bottlenecks
   - Make optimization improvements to address these bottlenecks
   - Focus on the known inefficiencies mentioned in the README.md

2. **Create a framework to test performance improvements**:
   - Develop a benchmarking framework that can compare the original vs. optimized versions
   - Measure execution time, memory usage, and CPU utilization
   - Ensure the framework can process different image sizes and quantities
   - Make the framework reusable for future optimization efforts

3. **Generate a comprehensive optimization report**:
   - Create a detailed report showing before and after metrics
   - Include specific improvements made and their impact
   - Provide code snippets highlighting key optimization changes
   - Document the methodology used for testing
   - Summarize the overall performance gains (speed, memory usage, etc.)
   - Include recommendations for future optimizations

## Getting Started:

1. First, explore the codebase to understand the current implementation
2. Run the installation and build commands from the devfile.yaml
3. Run the profiling tests to establish baseline performance
4. Implement optimizations incrementally, testing after each change
5. Use the profiling tools to validate improvements
6. Document your optimization process and results

Please maintain the same functionality while improving performance. The goal is to make the application more efficient without changing its core behavior or output quality.

When you're done, I'd like to see:
1. The optimized code
2. The benchmarking framework
3. A detailed optimization report with before/after metrics
